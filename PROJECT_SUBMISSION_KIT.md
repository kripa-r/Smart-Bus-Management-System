# Project Submission Kit (Ready-to-Use)

Use this file on final submission day.

## 1. Submission Day Checklist

### A. Code and App Health

- [ ] Open terminal in project root.
- [ ] Run: `git status` (working tree clean hona chahiye).
- [ ] Run: `python -m compileall app.py routes models services`.
- [ ] Run smoke test:
  - `python -c "from app import create_app; app=create_app(); print('ok', len(app.url_map._rules))"`
- [ ] App run check:
  - `python app.py`
  - Browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### B. Mandatory Functional Checks

- [ ] Auth flow: signup/login/logout.
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads correctly.
- [ ] Student attendance mark/update works.
- [ ] Driver dashboard logs render correctly.
- [ ] Bus management add/edit works.
- [ ] Mileage upload + approve/delete flow works.
- [ ] API checks:
  - [ ] `/health`
  - [ ] `/api/health`
  - [ ] `/api/bus_status`
  - [ ] `/api/all_bus_locations`

### C. Git and Repo Health

- [ ] `git status` clean.
- [ ] `.env` NOT tracked.
- [ ] `.venv` NOT tracked.
- [ ] DB/logs not tracked (`smartbus.db`, server logs).
- [ ] Latest commit pushed to `main`.

### D. Final Push Commands

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Submission ready: docs, polish, and final validation"
git push
```

If no file changed:
- Skip commit and just verify repo latest state.

## 2. Screenshot Plan (Sequence + Caption)

Capture exactly in this order.

- Caption: "Secure authentication entry for Smart Bus Management System"

2. Admin Dashboard
- Caption: "Admin dashboard with operational overview and quick actions"

3. Student Dashboard
- Caption: "Student dashboard for attendance and pickup stop selection"

4. Driver Dashboard
- Caption: "Driver dashboard with stop-wise student view and attendance logs"

5. Bus Management Page
- Caption: "Bus management module for route, RFID, and driver assignment"

6. Mileage Module
- Caption: "Mileage log upload, approval workflow, and status tracking"

7. Live Bus Map (Admin)
- Caption: "Live bus tracking map with GPS-based updates"

8. RFID/IoT Logs or Status API Output
- Caption: "IoT-enabled RFID and status integration for real-time operations"

### Screenshot Naming Convention

Use this exact format:

- `01-login.png`
- `02-admin-dashboard.png`
- `03-student-dashboard.png`
- `04-driver-dashboard.png`
- `05-bus-management.png`
- `06-mileage.png`
- `07-live-map.png`
- `08-iot-status.png`

## 3. GitHub Repository Profile Text (Copy-Paste)

### Repository Name

`smart-bus-management-system`

### Short Description (About Box)

`A Flask-based Smart Bus Management System with role-based dashboards, attendance tracking, mileage workflows, and IoT-enabled GPS/RFID integration.`

### Website (Optional)

- Add your deployed URL if available (Render or similar).

### Topics (GitHub Topics)

Add these topics exactly:

- `flask`
- `python`
- `smart-transport`
- `bus-management`
- `attendance-system`
- `iot`
- `rfid`
- `gps-tracking`
- `college-project`
- `bootstrap`

## 4. README Header Pitch (Optional Improvement)

Use this one-liner in presentations:

`Smart Bus Management System is a production-oriented college transport platform that digitizes attendance, route operations, and real-time IoT monitoring.`

## 5. Viva / Demo Script (2-3 Minutes)

### Intro (20 sec)

"This project is a Smart Bus Management System built using Flask. It supports role-based access for admin, management, driver, and student users."

### Core Features (60 sec)

"Students can mark attendance with pickup stop selection. Drivers can view stop-wise data and attendance logs. Admin can manage buses, approve mileage logs, and monitor operations."

### IoT + Tracking (40 sec)

"The system exposes RFID and GPS APIs to integrate ESP32 modules. This enables bus arrival events and live tracking endpoints for operational visibility."

### Technical Stack (30 sec)

"Backend is Flask with SQLAlchemy and migration support, frontend is Bootstrap with custom modern UI polish, and the project is deployment-ready with Render configuration."

### Closing (20 sec)

"Overall, this system improves transport transparency, reduces manual errors, and provides a scalable base for real-time smart campus transit." 

## 6. Emergency Fix Commands (If Something Breaks)

```powershell
# verify branch and changes
git status

# undo unstaged local edits in one file
git restore routes/mileage_routes.py

# pull latest safely
git pull --rebase origin main

# re-run quick health checks
python -m compileall app.py routes models services
python -c "from app import create_app; app=create_app(); print('ok')"
```

- [ ] Repo public/private as required by evaluator.
- [ ] README clean and understandable.
- [ ] Screenshots available in order.
- [ ] Latest commit visible on GitHub.
- [ ] Demo flow practiced once.
