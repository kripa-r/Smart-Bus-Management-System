# IoT Bus Arrival System — Complete Testing Guide

> **Update (2026-03-15):** Current gate endpoint is **POST `/api/rfid`** with payload `{ "uid": "72 3C 14 5C" }`. Live bus arrivals dashboard is `/admin/bus-arrivals` with **2-second** polling.

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step tests to validate the entire IoT bus arrival detection system, from backend APIs to frontend dashboards to hardware integration.

- A new arrival row is added

**Verification Steps:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM arrivals 
WHERE bus_id = 1 
AND created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MINUTE);
-- Should increase after each accepted POST
```

2. Create GET request:
   ```
   URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/api/bus-arrivals
   Method: GET
   Headers: Accept: application/json
   ```

3. Click **Send**

**Expected Result:**
- **Status Code:** 200 OK
- **Response Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "arrivals": [
      {
        "id": 123,
        "bus_number": "BUS-001",
        "route_name": "Route A",

**Objective:** Verify table displays actual arrival records

**Steps:**

1. On Admin Dashboard, below summary cards, find the "Latest Bus Arrivals" table
2. Observe table columns: Bus | Route | Driver | Arrival Time | Status
3. Verify rows display actual bus data

**Expected Result:**
- Table shows at least one row of arrival data
- Columns match: bus_number, route_name, driver_name, arrival_time, status badge
- Status badges are green (on_time) or red (late)
- Timestamps are formatted readably (e.g., "2024-01-15 09:05:30")

**Steps:**

1. Keep Admin Dashboard open and visible
2. In **another browser tab or Postman**, send a POST to `/api/rfid` with a known RFID UID
3. Note the current time
4. Watch the Admin Dashboard for changes

**Expected Result:**
- Within 2 seconds, new arrival appears in the table (at the top)
- Summary counts increase by 1 (in the appropriate status card)
- No manual refresh required

**Timing Note:** JavaScript polls every 2 seconds, so changes visible within 0-2 seconds.

**Prerequisites:**
- Current time must be past 9:10 AM

**Steps:**

1. Manually insert test arrivals via Postman:

   **Test Case A: Before Cutoff (On-Time)**
   ```bash
   # Create fake arrival at 9:05 AM
   # (This tests the calculation logic)
   ```

2. Verify in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM arrivals WHERE arrival_time < '09:10:00';
   -- Should have status = 'on_time'
   ```

3. Test Case B: After Cutoff (Late)
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM arrivals WHERE arrival_time > '09:10:00';
   -- Should have status = 'late'
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- Arrivals before 9:10 AM: status = "on_time" ✓
- Arrivals after 9:10 AM: status = "late" ✓
